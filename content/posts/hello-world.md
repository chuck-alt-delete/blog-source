This is the first post for `Chuck+Alt+Delete`! Welcome!

This site has two purposes:
- "learn in public" through blog posts
- host my professional portfolio

## Learn in Public

I was inspired by the `#LearnInPublic` hashtag on twitter. Learning in public makes one feel vulnerable, but the upsides in terms of community and learning can be tremendous. Even this post might evolve over time. This is a place for rough draft thinking.

## Portfolio

Hop over to my [portfolio](/posts/portfolio)!

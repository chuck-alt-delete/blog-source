== Foreword From 2021

A while ago, I listened to an https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/07/02/dynamodb-with-alex-debrie/[amazing podcast episode^] about DynamoDB decided to do one of https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/data-modeling-gaming-app-with-dynamodb/[AWS's DynamoDB hands-on tutorials^] and create a little presentation about what I learned to share at a meetup.

Enjoy!

== The Relational Way

Suppose we want to query for all the usernames of users in a particular game.

[cols="2a,a,a",options=header]
|===
|Star Schema
|Pros
|Cons



|* Table for "user"
* Table for "game"
* Fact table that relates "user_ID" with "game_ID"
* Join "user" and "game" tables and filter for records with the given "game_ID"

|* Great for ad-hoc queries
* Great for analytics, like aggregations

|* Joins don't scale well

== The DynamoDB Way

image::entities.png[]

This is all one big, hyper-scalable table! It looks like two entity tables and a join table, but really it's one big table where the entities and join are created by clever design of the primary and sort keys, which we'll see in the next slide.

NOTE: One table with O(1) lookup by primary key, or O(log(n)) if including a sort key. No joins! You _plan_ the access pattern into your data model and include everything in one table.

<<<

== Design the Primary Key

.Composite Primary Key
[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Entity	|Partition Key (a.k.a. HASH)	|Sort Key (a.k.a. RANGE)
|User	|`USER#<USERNAME>`	|`\#PLACEHOLDER#<USERNAME>`
|Game	|`GAME#<GAME_ID>`	|`\#PLACEHOLDER#<GAME_ID>`
|UserGameMapping	|`GAME#<GAME_ID>`	|`USER#<USERNAME>`
|===

<<<

== Code Example

Query multiple entities in one request to one table!

Take a moment to think about what this query does:

[source,python]
----
game_id = input("what game ID do you want to look up?")
resp = dynamodb.query(
        TableName='battle-royale',
        KeyConditionExpression="PK = :pk AND SK BETWEEN :placeholder AND :users",
        ExpressionAttributeValues={
            ":pk": { "S": "GAME#{}".format(game_id) },
            ":placeholder": { "S": "#PLACEHOLDER#{}".format(game_id) },
            ":users": { "S": "USER$" },
        },
        ScanIndexForward=True
    )
----

.sample response
[%collapsible]
====
This query takes a given game ID and looks up all the users in that game. Let's say the game ID is `abc123`. The `PK` part of the `KeyConditionExpression` stands for "Primary Key", which is the key used to determine which DynamoDB partition holds the data.

Now that we have found the partition where game ID `abc123` lives, the next step is to use the sort key, `SK`, to grab all the users. We look up records in order from `:placeholder` to `:users`, which are further specified in the `ExpressionAttributeValues` parameter. The `:placeholder` expression corresponds to the string `#PLACEHOLDER#abc123` (type denoted by `S`). The expression `:users` corresponds to the string `USER$`.

The `\#` symbol is 35 in ascii, and `$` is 36, so `USER$` is greater than all `USER#<USERNAME>` entries. That means this query will return, for example: 

```
{"GAME#abc123" : "#PLACEHOLDER#abc123"}
{"GAME#abc123": "USER#myuser1"}
{"GAME#abc123": "USER#myuser2"}
{"GAME#abc123": "USER#myuser3"}
...
```

== Next Step: Secondary Indexes

Secondary indexes are very useful in DynamoDB. They allow you to query data by attributes other than the primary key. This opens up more access patterns. The benefits of secondary indexes come at the cost ($ literally $) of more reads and writes as DynamoDB automatically updates indexes. It is easy to use secondary indexes poorly, so I encourage you to dig into the tutorial in the reference to learn more about best practices with secondary indexes. Namely:

* *Sparse* secondary index
** Create an index that filters down to a specific subset that won't grow indefinitely
** example: create index to find all open games on a specific map
* *Inverted* index
** Switch the roles of primary key and sort key
** example: find all games a user has played (opposite of what we did earlier when we found all users in a specific game)

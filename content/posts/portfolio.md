Most of my work these last few years has lived in private repositories, so I've created this site to do more "learning in public." I will keep this page updated with exemplars of my work.

## Free Courses 

As a Senior Curriculum Developer at [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io), I have written many courses related distributed systems, databases, and stream processing. Most of my courses are only available as a part of a paid subscription, but there are a couple of free samples you can check out. Go to the [Confluent training website](https://training.confluent.io/self-userpackage) and check out:

- Automate Deployment with Confluent for Kubernetes
  - Whole course is free, including fully managed hands-on labs
- Try It - Create an Event Streaming App with ksqlDB
  - First couple of modules are free

## Old GitHub

Once upon a time, I noodled around on https://github.com/chuckinator0, which I have since replaced with this "Chuck Alt Delete" personal brand. Here are a couple of highlights:

- [scripts](https://github.com/chuckinator0/Projects/tree/master/scripts): A collection of programming exercises I've done. I might make some blog posts based on some of these.
- [secretSanta](https://github.com/chuckinator0/Projects/tree/master/secretSanta): A simple app that assigns secret santas and emails the family. This is actual critical infrastructure for my family's annual secret santa tradition. It ensures no one gets the same person they got last year, nor do they get their spouse.

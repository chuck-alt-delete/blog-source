Most of my work these last few years has lived in private repositories, so I've created this site to do more "learning in public." I will keep this page updated with exemplars of my work.

## Technical Marketing Assets

As a Technical Marketing Manager at Confluent, I create and review blogs, whitepapers, demos, and videos. Here are a couple of assets to highlight:

- SIEM Optimization
  - I heavily refactored a SIEM Optimization demo created by our enterprise sales engineers
  - I added self-paced learning modules and executive brief documentation
  - I added 0-setup, 1-click deployment with Gitpod ([click here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-siem-optimization) to run demo in your browser) 
  - [Demo Repo](https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-siem-optimization)

- Confluent Platform Demo
  - I took ownership of our flagship showcase demo and am sole maintainer (as of writing)
  - I refactored the demo to use Confluent Cluster Linking instead of Confluent Replicator and added Schema Linking
  - GitHub Repo: https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-demo

- 10x Storage (10x Campaign)
  - [Video conversation](https://www.confluent.io/en-gb/resources/online-talk/10x-apache-kafka-storage/)
  - [Demo repo: Training Machine Learning Models using Confluent Infinite Storage](https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-10x-storage)

- Trust Confluent Campaign
  - [Demo repo](https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-trust)
  - [Video](https://www.confluent.io/resources/online-talk/trusted-data-streaming-with-confluent-cloud/)
